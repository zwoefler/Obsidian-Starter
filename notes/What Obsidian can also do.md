But [[Obsidian]] can do more things like:
- Embedding other files
- List items
- Create Task lists
- Tables
- Insert Codeblocks via ```example code```  and `inline code`
- Quotes and Quoteblocks
- Embedding images and resizing them
- Use Aliases for filenames (Have a look in line 3)


## Templating
`ALT + E` gives you an overview for all the available templates.
Besides, you can also create your own.

All my regularly used templates are identified by their first character.
So for `S` the first mention is the `Source (Template)`, while `Starter Note (Template)` is only for background automation!

Hit `ALT + E`, type in `S` and hit **ENTER** will insert the Source template, just like below:

- 👤 Creator(s) ::
- 📼 Format ::
- 🛰️ Platform ::
- 📅 Published::
- 🔗 URL ::



#### Blocks / Callouts
[[Obsidian]] includes many blocks that are rendered with a color.
A two examples are the `Quote` or the `ERROR`

Creating a Block is done by opening the [[Command Palette]], **type** `call` and select the `Insert callout` function.

Below you see a few examples:

> [!NOTE] Title
> Contents

> [!ERROR] ERROR Clock
> Watch out for this stuff!

> [!SUMMARY]  Summary
> I am good at the top of a note!
