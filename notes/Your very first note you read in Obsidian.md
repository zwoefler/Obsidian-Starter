> [!ABSTRACT] Some remarks
[[Obsidian]] can be used in many different ways and is a powerful tool to collect and connect your knowledge. 
🧭 Adapt and explore however you see it fit! Even I haven't figured all the little things [[Obsidian]] can do.
Adapt it to whatever fits your style, use the Documentation :![[Your very first note you read in Obsidian#^877d02]]
This installation has some Plugins installed which are described in [[What Obsidian can also do#Plugins]]



#### 🧭 Navigation
Either use the **arrow** in the **top left corner**

Or use the shortcut:: 
- Go back:: **CTRL + ALT +  <--** 
- Go forward:: **CTRL + ALT + -->**

You can also Open the [[Quickswitcher]]:: **CTRL + O** and find a different note!

Or you can use the [[Backlink Panel]] by clicking on the **arrow** to the right side!



#### 📜 Formatting text

- **bold**:: CTRL + B
