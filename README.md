## ‚å®Ô∏è Basic Hotkeys
- CTRL + O :: **Quickswitcher**, lets you find files
- CTRL + P :: **Command Palette**, execute commands
- CTRL + W :: **Closes current note**
- ALT + E  :: **Include Template**



## What the template includes
### Templater
A basic template that moves files that start with an `@` into the `People` folder.

Hitting **ALT + E** will open the templater menu.
A few basic templates such as
- `Source (Template)`
- `Link (Template)`
- `Origin (Template)`
can be imported and used to save valuable time writing notes.

The templater is a powerful tool, as you can create your own templates.

### üìÖ Daily notes / Journal
Every day a new note with the current day is created and opened as the default note


### üóíÔ∏è Footnotes
Hitting **CTRL + SHIFT + ^** will include a Footnote at the bottom of the note.
Hitting **CTRL + SHIFT + ^** again will jump back to the text




## üí° Tips
- Write notes in your own words
- When you find yourself writing the same thing twice, try automating it with a template!
- Include Links (URL) as sources for your knowledge


## üöß Some remarks
Obsidian works great for me, but may not work for you!
Many things can be automated via Javascript or existing Plugins.
You can build templates, copy your folder structure and so on.
Obsidian is text based, and so should be your knowledge. If you find yourself working with lots of images, code

However some people find it overwhelming. And that is fine!

Obsidian might **not** be for you when:
- You only write short shopping lists
- Already have a working note taking solution
- Don't like to work with Markdown
- Need a good mobile App

### Installed Plugins
- **Advanced Tables**:: Helps you out with tables
- **Excalidraw**:: Let's your create simple drwaings
- **Footnote Shortcut**:: Create footnotes
- **Obsidian Charts**:: Create simple charts
- **Templater**:: Allows for complex templates
